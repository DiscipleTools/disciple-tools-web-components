# Disciple Tools Web Component Library

A set of standard components to be used across the [Disciple.Tools](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme) system

See the live documentation on the [Storybook](https://jade-chebakia-17493f.netlify.app/).

# Get Started

These components are already included in the Disciple.Tools theme. If you are working in the theme or a plugin that is within the standard user interface, you can start using the components now without any extra including of scripts or styles.

In other cases, see the below samples for how to use the components in other scenarios.

## Samples

- [Use in static HTML](./samples/html) (Note: Need to [Build for use in HTML](#build-for-use-in-html), see below)
- [Use in React](./samples/react-include)
- [Use in Vue](./samples/vue-include)
- [Extend your own Lit Components](./samples/lit-extend)

# Developing Components

## Installation

Clone the Repo then run`npm install`

## Build for use in HTML

To build/transpile the components for use in basic HTML as a script include, run the following:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with all of the final javascript files that can be included in any HTML page like so:

```html
<script src="/dist/index.js"></script>
```

You can then use any of the new elements in your HTML and they will be used from this library.

## Demoing with Storybook
See the current Storybook [here](https://jade-chebakia-17493f.netlify.app/).

To run a local instance of Storybook for your component, run

```bash
npm run storybook
```

To build a production version of Storybook, run

```bash
npm run storybook:build
```

## Coding Standards

### Linting
To scan the project for linting and formatting errors, run

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Formatting
To automatically fix linting and formatting errors, run

```bash
npm run format
```

### Component Standards
The [Standards](./Standards.md) file contains a description of the implementation details that are expected for components.

They are written so that you can provide them to an AI coding agent and have it update the component for you:

```
Use the Standards.md file to make sure everything in src/components/form/dt-my-component is up to date
```

## Automated Testing

![Test Status](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-web-components/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

To execute a single test run:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run the tests in interactive watch mode run:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

```bash
npm start
```

To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`

## Localization
Localization happens in 3 steps:
1. Use localized strings in code 
2. Extract all of the strings used in the code to XLIFF file
3. Build localized templates for use in code

### Using localized strings
See [Lit Localize docs](https://lit.dev/docs/localization/overview/#message-types) for full documentation.

When outputting text within a component that is not coming from the user (and would thus be translated by the user), use the `msg` function:

```
import {msg} from '@lit/localize';

class MyComp extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return msg(html`Hello <b>${this.who}</b>`);
  }
}
customElements.define('my-comp', MyComp);
```

The locale can either be passed into the component via attribute/property, or else it will attempt to read the direction and language from the nearest parent elements with `dir` and/or `lang` attributes.

### Extract Messages
See [Lit Localize docs](https://lit.dev/docs/localization/overview/#extracting-messages) for full documentation.

Run `lit-localize extract` in the console to generate XLIFF files into the `/xliff/` directory. These should be able to be imported into translation software for translators to set the values. 

The XLIFF files should be updated by translators and saved back into the space directory with correct translations.

### Build localized templates
See [Lit Localize docs](https://lit.dev/docs/localization/overview/#building-localized-templates) for full documentation.

Run `lit-localize build` to process XLIFF files into javascript files that are saved into `/i18n/generated/{locale}.js`. These files are used by the `msg` function to use the correct localized string based on the selected locale.
