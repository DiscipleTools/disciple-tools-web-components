# Introduction

## Why Web Components?

HTML custom elements are now widely supported across browsers, and building encapsulated web
components allows us to package logic and styles for the defined field types within Disciple.Tools.
By doing this, the main theme doesn't need other javascript dependencies and initialization scripts,
and PHP developers can stick to writing PHP instead of also needing to figure out complex javascript
interactions.

## Main Concepts

This web components library was built with a few main concepts in mind that drive the initial and future development:

- **HTML/Framework Support**: Components should work in a standard HTML form, via events and API requests, and by including in other javascript frameworks. Whatever method developers want to use the components should be supported.
- **Loose Coupling**: Components do not implement specific Disciple.Tools APIs directly within their functionality. Events are dispatched for coupling to APIs or other data sources, and the `ComponentService` provides coupling to standard APIs when needed.
- **Javascript Events**: Communication outside the components happens by dispatching javascript events
- **CSS Customization**: Styles default to the main Disciple.Tools styles, but can be customized at various layers via CSS variables/properties. Change styles for all components or for a single component. Styling should be versatile.

## Getting Started

## Install
### NPM

The easiest way to include the web components is to use NPM. If your project will make use of NPM, you can run:

```bash
npm i @disciple.tools/web-components
```

You can then include the library based on the type of project you're working on:

### Manual Build

See [git repo](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-web-components#build-for-use-in-html) for details on
how to manually build the components to include in a project without NPM.

## Include Scripts

### Javascript Projects (React, Vue, etc.)

```javascript
import '@disciple.tools/web-components';
```

Your framework may need a wrapper component to make these components work, so see the
specific documentation for your framework.

- [React Sample Documentation](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-web-components/tree/master/samples/react-include)
- [Vue Sample Documentation](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-web-components/tree/master/samples/vue-include)

### Standard HTML

See [HTML Sample Documentation](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-web-components/tree/master/samples/html)

#### CDN
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@disciple.tools/web-components@0.7.0/styles/light.css" type="text/css" media="all">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@disciple.tools/web-components@0.7.0/dist/index.js"></script>
```

#### Local Include
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/@disciple.tools/web-components/src/styles/light.css" type="text/css" media="all">
<script src="/path/to/@disciple.tools/web-components/dist/index.js"></script>
```


### WordPress

If you're using the Disciple.Tools theme, the components are all included (only in the `next` branch releases for now)
and can be used without explicitly including scripts.

If you are writing a Magic Link or other plugin for WordPress that doesn't include the theme files,
you'll need to include the script files.

#### CDN

```php

$dtwc_version = '0.7.0';
wp_enqueue_style( 'dt-web-components-css', "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@disciple.tools/web-components@$dtwc_version/styles/light.css", [], $dtwc_version );
wp_enqueue_script( 'dt-web-components-js', "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@disciple.tools/web-components@$dtwc_version/dist/index.js", $dtwc_version );

```

#### Local Include

```php
$path = '../path/to/components/dist/index.js';
wp_enqueue_script( 'dt-web-components-js',
  plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) . $path,
  null,
  filemtime( plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . $path )
);

$css_path = '../path/to/components/src/styles/light.css';
wp_enqueue_style( 'dt-web-components-css',
  plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) . $css_path,
  null,
  filemtime( plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . $css_path )
);
```

## Render Components

Once your scripts are included, you can use the components like you would any other standard
HTML elements when you render your page.

```html
<html>
<head>...</head>
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>My Page</h1>
    <div>
      <dt-text id='textField' name='textField' label="My Text Field"></dt-text>
    </div>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```
