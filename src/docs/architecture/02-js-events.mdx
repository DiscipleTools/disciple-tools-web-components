# Javascript Events

The primary way that the components communicate with the containing page is by dispatching
javascript events. Interacting with them is as easy as listening for events like you do for
any standard HTML component

## Add Event Listener

To listen for an event, attach an event listener:

```html
<dt-text id="my-text-input" name="my-text"></dt-text>

<script>
function myEventListener(evt) {
  console.log(evt);
}
document.getElementById('my-text-input').addEventListener('event-name', myEventListener);
</script>
```

## Example: Change Event

A standard event for all of the form components is the change event. This gets triggered any time
the value of a form component changes.

Let's take a look at the text field to see how you might use it.

```html
<dt-text id="my-text-input" name="my-text"></dt-text>

<script>
function onChange(evt) {
  const detail = evt.detail;
  console.log(`input with name '${detail.field}' was changed to '${detail.newValue}`);
  // here is where you can fire an API request to save this value
}
document.getElementById('my-text-input').addEventListener('change', onChange);
</script>
```

All of the `Event` objects that are passed to the event listener will contain a `detail` property
that has all of the data relevant to that event.

For this `change` event, the `Event` would have values like this:

```json
{
  "type": "change",
  "detail": {
    "field": "my-text",
    "oldValue": "",
    "newValue": "[what the user typed]"
  },
  [...]
}
```
