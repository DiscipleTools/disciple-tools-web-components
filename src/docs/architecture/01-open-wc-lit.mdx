# Open WC / Lit

## Open WC

This library was started using [Open WC](https://open-wc.org/) tools and recommendations.
Because of that, all of the testing tools are tightly tied to how Open WC uses them.

## Lit Element

The primary library used for writing the components is [Lit Elements](https://lit.dev/docs/).
See their documentation first for any questions on how the inner workings of the components
function.

Although Lit has their Lit HTML package that is like other javascript frameworks, Lit Element
is just a utility library used for building standalone web components.

Useful docs for reference:
