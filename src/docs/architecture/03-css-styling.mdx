# CSS Styling

The way that HTML custom elements and the shadow DOM work, you can't style the components through
normal stylesheets included on your page. The styles are scoped within the component and
the only CSS from outside that can pass through is CSS variables and custom properties.

You can see [Lit's documentation](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/#theming) about the process for more information.

## Theming Disciple.Tools Web Components

While building our components, we have integrated a variety of CSS custom properties to allow
theming the whole library with just a few properties, or customizing a specific component with
other properties.

To see all of the CSS custom properties that are used in the components, you can look at the main
[light.css](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-web-components/blob/master/src/styles/light.css)
for their current definitions and see how they inherit from each other.

Style properties can be set at 3 different levels:
- Global
- All Form Components
- Individual Components

At each level, you can adjust:
- Colors
  - Primary
  - Text
  - Surface
  - Border
  - Statuses (alert, caution, success, inactive, disabled)
- Font Family
- Shadows

Each component also has a specific set of properties that you can adjust. See the documentation
for the [components](?path=/story/components-all--components) to see which properties are available.
