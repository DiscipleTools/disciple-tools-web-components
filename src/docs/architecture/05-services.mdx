# Services

Two helper services are included in the library to help with initializing components when
sending values to the Disciple.Tools API.

- [ApiService](#apiservice)
- [ComponentService](#componentservice)

## ApiService

This will provide a structured way to send and receive data with the standard Disciple.Tools API.

### Initialization

To initialize, instantiate the class while passing a WP nonce (for authentication) and the
root path of the WordPress API (if different than `wp-json`).

```javascript
const apiService = new ApiService(wpnonce);
```

### Utility Methods

A few utility methods are used internally to share logic among all the endpoint methods:

#### `makeRequest`

##### Arguments

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| type | string | HTTP Method |
| url  | string | Either full URL to API endpoint or just the URL segment after base |
| data | object | Post data to send in body of request |
| base (optional) | Base of URL endpoint. Defaults to "dt/v1/" |

##### Return

Promise with body of response as JSON object.

#### `makeRequestOnPosts`

Specific use of `makeRequest` for all of the endpoints that are specific to a given post.
Sets the `base` argument and passes all of the rest through to `makeRequest`

`return this.makeRequest(type, url, data, 'dt-posts/v2/');`

### Endpoint Methods

Most standard endpoints that are needed for the web components have been implemented.
Those include (but may not be limited to):

- getPost
- createPost
- updatePost
- deletePost
- listPostsCompact
- getPostDuplicates
- getMultiSelectValues
- transferContact
- transferContactSummaryUpdate
- requestRecordAccess
- createComment
- updateComment
- deleteComment
- getComments
- toggle_comment_reaction
- getPostActivity
- getSingleActivity
- revertActivity
- getPostShares
- addPostShare
- removePostShare
- getFilters
- saveFilters
- deleteFilter
- searchUsers
- createUser
- advanced_search

See the [source code](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-web-components/blob/master/src/services/apiService.js)
for details of all endpoints included.

Refer to [theme documentation](https://developers.disciple.tools/theme-core/api-posts)
for all of the available endpoints.

## ComponentService

The ComponentService helps to initialize the ApiService and hook up all change events for a given
page on Disciple.Tools. Once a post page is loaded in the theme, you just run the following
to setup all of the needed event listeners:

```javascript
const componentService = new ComponentService(postType, postId, nonce, apiRoot);
componentService.initialize();
```

The **initialize** method will do two things: 1) listen for change events on all D.T components
and automatically save the updated values via API, and 2) setup `load` events for all components
that need to request data from the API for a list of options.

The service will automatically map the format of the value from the JS object in the component
to the schema that the API requires. This way you don't have to know which format is needed in which
place - the service handles it for you.
