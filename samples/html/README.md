# Sample: Basic HTML Include

To run this example, run `npm run build` in the root of the project to build javascript files.

## Run in Browser

```
npm start
```

Run to serve the static html page for viewing in your browser.

## How Components Are Included

In any HTML page, add a script include like the below either in the `<head>` or wherever your scripts are included.

```html
<script src="/path/to/disciple-tools-web-components/dist/index.js"></script>
```

Make sure that you are including the files from the `dist` directory as those are transpiled for direct use in the browser.
